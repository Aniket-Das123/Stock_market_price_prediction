# Stock_market_price_prediction
In this project I used yahooo finance dataset for stock market price prediction using Long Short term memory. 
Input is taken by the user as the stock ticker then it will train the LSTM model and predict the result and find the mean absolute error, atlast it will show the graph of actual and predicted stock prices with two different lines.
